# Msc_Data_Science_Project

**Socioeconomic Status (SES) Prediction Web Application**

*Project Overview*
This project develops an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts an individualâ€™s socioeconomic status (SES) using demographic and employment attributes. The system classifies whether an individual earns above or below $50,000 annually using machine learning models.

The final deployed model is Gradient Boosting, chosen for its high accuracy (80%) and AUC-ROC (0.87), ensuring strong real-world predictive performance.

*Features*

Predict SES using five key demographic/employment attributes:

Occupation (OCCP)

Work Hours per Week (WKHP)

Education Level (SCHL)

Age (AGEP)

Sex (SEX)

Clean, Bootstrap-styled user interface (online Bootstrap CDN used).

Real-time predictions without saving any user data.

Fully interactive experience from input to prediction.

Note:
This deployment is for academic demonstration only and is ethically compliant (no real user data is collected or stored).

Key Highlights
Dataset: Subset of the Folktables dataset derived from the American Community Survey (ACS).

Final Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier.

Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: 80%

AUC-ROC: 0.87

Deployment Platform: Replit.

Future Improvements
Expand the model to cover more detailed SES attributes.

Improve feature engineering for even stronger prediction accuracy.

Upgrade hosting to a production environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for scalable use.
